# esolangs-interpreter
List of my esolangs interpreter, along with many others

I am pretty much a high school students who codes after wasting 2 hours to doing homework, so my code won't even be that good. Written in (mostly) C++
I will also try to find the person who is behind the language.
However the compilers here are by me.
